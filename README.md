# Configuration Details

- feel free to use my neofetch configuration if you like it :P. i originally posted this for my personal use but i'm happy to share it with others who might find it useful.
- btw the neofetch picture is in the repo configured for Kitty Terminal. (i recommend not using the picture because it's pretty buggy)
